        <h2>Dragon Vehicle Overview</h2>

        <p>Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting destinations. Dragon 
            made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft in history to deliver cargo to the 
            International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat previously achieved only by governments. 
            It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. 
            Currently Dragon carries cargo to space, but it was designed from the beginning to carry humans. Under an 
            agreement with NASA, SpaceX is now developing the refinements that will enable Dragon to fly crew. Dragon's 
            first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.

            <dl>
                <dt>DELIVERY AND RETURN SERVICES</dt>
                <dd>Dragon is the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and 
                    currently the only cargo spacecraft flying capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. 
                    Dragon accommodates pressurized cargo in the capsule as well as unpressurized cargo in its trunk.

                <dd>
                    The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction designed for efficient packing in a zero-gravity 
                    environment. They accommodate a variety of standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as freezers for 
                    carrying materials such as biological samples.

                <dd>
                    Dragon was designed from the outset to fly humans to space. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is 
                    making upgrades to Dragon to allow for crew carrying capability.

                <dt>CREW UPGRADES</dt>
                <dd>Dragon will be the world’s safest and most reliable crew transport vehicle, with seating for seven, 
                    life-support systems, controls with manual capability, and a powered launch escape system.
                </dd>

                <dd>
                    Upgrades to Dragon are currently in progress. Dragon’s first manned test flight is expected to take 
                    place as early as 2018.

                <dd>
                    DragonLab is a free-flying, unmanned platform designed for research and testing in a microgravity 
                    environment independent of the International Space Station.
                </dd>
                <dt>LONGEVITY</dt>
                <dd>
                    It can transport payloads, experiments, instruments, and sensors into space and back to Earth on 
                    missions ranging from one week to two years.
                </dd>

                <dd>
                    DragonLab can readily accommodate instrument and sensor testing, space physics and relativity 
                    experiments, radiation effects research, and many other microgravity tests.
