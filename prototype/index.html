        <h1>My Past Coding Experience</h1>
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>I have been programming for <em>about</em> 6 years now (since I was 12). Through the years, I have dabbled 
                (and am currently dabbling in) many languages. Seven languages, to be exact. Some I'm still learning,
                others I feel I've mastered, but still use frequently, and some I just don't mess with at all anymore.</p>

            <p>In this project, I am going to create a prototype document detailing my previous experience
                coding/programming. This will include the languages I have learned (and am learning), previous projects
                I have created, commissions, and even some sample code from previous projects. I will be utilizing
                all of the HTML elements I have learned so far this year within my prototype document.</p>

                    <blockquote><dd>Roblox is an open sandbox game that allows users to create and share their creations with thousands
                        of other users. Roblox Studio is used to create these games, and the coding langauge the creators use
                        is Lua C. I coded a Script Executor that allows the players to input and execute their own scripts 
                        from within the game.
