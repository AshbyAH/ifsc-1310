    <h2>SpaceX Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>

    <p>
        I did not have time to ask a peer for input/feedback on my mini-site, so instead, I chose some revisions on my own.
      The first thing I decided to add on for my final draft were buttons at the bottom of the home page that will 
      jump to certain sections of the home page. The other revision I made was adding a second article to the article list.
      This article, instead of being solely focused on Dragon by SpaceX, analyzes the company SpaceX's entire vision
      and goal as a whole.

        I actually really enjoyed this project, I enjoy customizing the page with CSS quite a bit.
      I was always really into GUI design, and this is a lot similar to that, so it is quite an enjoyable experience for me.
      I was also quite satisfied with the color scheme/theme I ended up choosing. It fits both the category of futurism,
      AND space/astrology at the same time.
